# TriangleTiling

![](pentagon.gif)

Classes and execution scripts for generating logarithmic triangle tilings, based on
[this paper](https://www.mathartfun.com/FathauerBridges2021v1.pdf).

* ``TriangleTiling.py`` defines the classes for generating the tilings
* ``run.py`` generates Figure 15c from the paper
* ``generate_animation.py`` generates an animation of the tiling for the case of $n=1$ and $m=5$, for a variety of angles $C$.
